# PyFind: Building a Python command-line tool

In this tutorial we will build a command-line tool in Python, and
along the way learn about some modules that make this task easier.


## Chapter 0: Get files from Git

Fork and clone the
[starter repository](https://www.github.com/cruhland/pyfind/).

## Chapter 1: Introducing find

We will build a Python version of the Unix `find` command. The `find`
command searches through directory trees for files matching certain
criteria.
